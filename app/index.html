        <h1>Overview of Healthcare Access in the US</h1>
        <p>The NHIS is the nation’s largest in-person household health survey. It has been conducted annually since 1957 by
            the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
            (CDC). Interviewing is done by the U.S. Census Bureau’s field staff. During face-to-face interviews, participants
            provided sociodemographic data and information about health insurance coverage status.</p>
        <p>The purpose of our research project is to explore health insurance coverage using the <strong>National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)</strong>            data. A broad range of topics are covered within the dataset, but we will specifically focus on <strong>healthcare access and expenditure</strong>            across a multitude of factors such as race and healthcare sources. We will explore three specific questions.</p>

        <h3>Healthcare Access</h3>
        <p> One specific set of question asked by the field staff was the health insurance coverage status. The following visualization
            displays a high level overview of the percentage of people who <strong>didn't</strong> have any health insurance.
            According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/nhis_questionnaires.htm">codebook</a>, uninsured individuals
            include:
        </p>
        <blockquote>"Those without any private insurance, or without public health insurance coverage through Medicaid, Medicare, military
            health care (1976 forward), Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (1999 forward), or a state-sponsored or
            other government program (1997 forward). Persons covered only by a private plan that paid for one type of service,
            such as accidents or dental care, are also considered uninsured. Persons covered only by the Indian Health Service
            (1993 forward) are coded as having no health insurance. "</blockquote>

                    <text>To explore the question above, we looked at data from the 05' to 15' NHIS surveys, downloaded from

                            href="https://ihis.ipums.org/ihis/">this</a> website. Using a stratified random sample, we counted the weighted total of the population
                            who responded "No" to having any health insurance coverage. We then compared this to to the weighted
                            population for that respective year, ultimately getting a weighted proportion of people that
                            respective year who didn't have health insurance, accompanied by a confidence interval.

                        Overall, there seems to be an upward trend of proportion of people who don't have healthcare.
