        <h1>Overview of Healthcare in the US</h1>
        <p>The NHIS is the nation’s largest in-person household health survey. It has been conducted annually since 1957 by
            the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
            (CDC). Interviewing is done by the U.S. Census Bureau’s field staff. During face-to-face interviews, participants
            provided sociodemographic data and information about health insurance coverage status.</p>
        <p>The purpose of our research project is to explore health insurance coverage using the <strong>National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)</strong>            data. A broad range of topics are covered within the dataset, but we will specifically focus on <strong>healthcare access and expenditure</strong>            across a multitude of factors such as race and healthcare sources.</p>

        <h2>How has the amount of money spent for medical care changed over the years?</h2>
        <p> One specific set of question asked by the field staff was the health insurance coverage status. Below provides a
            high level overview of the percentage of people who didn't have any health insurance. According to the codebook,
            uninsured individuals include:</p>
        <div class="container">
            <blockquote>"Those without any private insurance, or without public health insurance coverage through Medicaid, Medicare,
                military health care (1976 forward), Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (1999 forward), or a state-sponsored
                or other government program (1997 forward). Persons covered only by a private plan that paid for one type
                of service, such as accidents or dental care, are also considered uninsured. Persons covered only by the
                Indian Health Service (1993 forward) are coded as having no health insurance. "</blockquote>
