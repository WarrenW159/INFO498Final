By using these data, you signify your agreement to comply with the above-stated statutorily-based requirements. 

Furthermore, users of IHIS data must agree to abide by the conditions of use. Users must agree to the following conditions: 
  
  
(1) Use the data in these data files for statistical reporting and analysis only 

(2) Make no use of the identity of any person or establishment discovered inadvertently and advise the Director of NCHS of any such discovery (301-458-4500) 

(3) Do not link these data with individually-identifiable data from NCHS or non-NCHS data files 

(4) No fees may be charged for use or distribution of the data.  All persons are granted a limited license to use and distribute these data, but you may not charge a fee for the data if you distribute them to others. 

(5) Cite the IHIS appropriately.  Publications and research reports based on the database must cite it appropriately.  Please see http://www.ihis.ipums.org/ihis/citation.shtml

(6) IHIS cannot be used to study small geographic areas.  The smallest geographical areas identified in the IHIS are regions (groups of states) and a limited number of metropolitan areas. 

(7) This system provides individual-level data only.  The IHIS Data Extraction System will not produce tables. You will need to use a statistical software package, such as STATA, SAS, or SPSS, to analyze the downloaded data.  Alternatively, you may use the IHIS-SDA tabulator to produce tables online, without making a data extract. ]]></conditions>

      <txt><![CDATA[RECTYPE is an IHIS-constructed variable that assigns all household-level records the alphabetic string "H." This allows users to discriminate between household and person records; the latter are assigned the string "P". For non-vacant households, each household record is followed by one or more person records. Data at the household level pertain to each person in the household.

The IHIS variable RECTYPE should not be confused with the NHIS public use variable "rectype," which distinguishes each NHIS file type (e.g., household, person, conditions, sample adult, etc.).]]></txt>

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly with supplements where a random adult or child family member was selected for questioning. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the sample adult/sample child supplements from 1997 forward should use SAMPWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT.

      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the section of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, 
race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

      <txt><![CDATA[FWEIGHT is a variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used for many analyses at the family level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about family characteristics. 


Creating FWEIGHT requires using independent estimates of the number of families from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau in order to perform post-stratification adjustments in a manner similar to what was done for the person-level weights. However, such independent estimates do not exist. 

As a result, the NHIS used the "principle person" method to create family-level weights. The person weight with the smallest ratio adjustment within each family was used as a proxy for the family-level ratio adjustment. This method is believed to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of U.S. families than either the use of other person weights within the family or the use of no ratio adjustments at all. Therefore, the Family weight contains factors for selection probabilities at the household level, household non-response adjustment, and several ratio adjustment factors that are applied to all person weights.

      <labl>Educational attainment</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[EDUC reports the highest level of schooling an individual had completed, in terms of completed grades for persons with less than a high school degree, and in terms of degrees attained for high school graduates and those with higher education.  Respondents were handed a card listing recognized categories and asked to identify the correct category.

According to the Field Representative's Manuals for 1997-2000, only "regular schooling which advances a person toward an elementary or high school diploma, or a college/university/professional school (such as law, medicine, dentistry)" counted as education.  Schooling in settings other than "regular schools" counted only if the credits obtained were acceptable in a regular school system.  Thus, for example, "adult education" classes not taken for credit or for the attainment of a college degree did not count.  

For the end of high school, EDUC distinguishes between those who completed twelfth grade but did not attain a diploma (e.g., those who failed to pass state-mandated high school exit examinations), those who graduated from high school, and those passed the GED (General Equivalence Degree) Test (which certifies that the test taker has attained high school-level academic skills).  Persons who attained a high school diploma in less than twelve years were to be recorded as "high school graduates," a guideline consistent with EDUC's emphasis on degrees attained rather than years spent in the classroom.  The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to probe to determine whether persons who attended "post-graduate" high school classes but did not attend college had received a high school diploma.  

For nurses, interviewers were to determine whether training was received in a college or in a nursing school (with the grade completed at the last regular--non-nursing--school to be entered in the latter case).  For a person attending special education classes or a school for persons with mental, physical, or developmental difficulties, interviewers were to ask which grade in a regular school most closely matched the individual's education level.  Persons currently in school were generally assumed to have completed the previous grade.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HCSPENDY reports about how much the family spent for medical care, including dental care, during the past 12 months.  Interviewers directed respondents to exclude the insurance premiums, over-the-counter drugs, and any costs for which they expected to be reimbursed.

HCSPENDY provides only a rough estimate of the family's expenditures on medical care.  Respondents were shown a card listing 6 categories [zero; less than $500; $500-$1,999; $2,000-$2,999; $3,000-$4,999; $5000 or more] and were expected to pick the category that most closely matched the medical expenditures of their family during the past 12 months.

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 stated that the estimate of family expenditures on medical care should include "only medical expenditures which could be counted as itemized deductions on income tax forms such as mental health care, eye-exams and glasses and prescription medicines."  This directive was not routinely reported to respondents during the interview.]]></txt>

      <labl>Medical care delayed due to cost, past 12 months</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[DELAYCOST indicates whether, during the past twelve months, individuals delayed seeking medical care because of worry about the cost.  For 1997 forward, respondents were told not to include dental care when answering this question.

 The Field Representative's Manual for 1993 forward noted, "Delayed assumes that medical care has been or will eventually be received."  This definition of the term was not routinely shared with respondents.

Related Variables

Several other variables available for 1997 forward address reasons other than "worry about the cost" that caused sample adults and sample children to delay getting medical care.  The non-financial reasons for delays in getting medical care identified in these variables are:  "you couldn't get an appointment soon enough" (DELAYAPPT); "the clinic/doctor's office wasn't open when you could get there" (DELAYHRS); "you couldn't get through on the telephone" (DELAYPHONE); "you didn't have transportation" (DELAYTRANS); and "once you get there, you have to wait too long to see the doctor" (DELAYWAIT). 

Available for 1997 forward, YBARCARE, which identifies individuals who needed but did not get medical care because they could not afford it during the past 12 months, covers some of the same ground as DELAYCOST.  However, the wording of the question for YBARCARE implies that medical care was foregone for financial reasons, while the wording of the question for DELAYCOST refers to care delayed for financial reasons.  The difference in these two variables may, however, be less than is implied by this semantic distinction.  In the case of some acute illnesses (such as respiratory infections and "stomach flu"), medical care that was delayed was doubtless ultimately foregone in many cases.

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPUBCOVE is a recoded variable created by the IHIS staff, which indicates, for all persons, whether the individual had health insurance coverage through Medicaid, any other state or other local government program that pays for health care, or, for 1999 forward, the Children's Health Insurance Program. 

For all years, the period of coverage refers to at the time of the survey. The component variables used to construct it are: HIMCAIDE, HISTATEE , HICHIPE, and  HIOTHGOVE.  HIPUBCOV excludes military coverage ( HIMILITE), Medicare (HIMCAREE), and Indian Health Service coverage (HIHSE).

 
Data Collection

For 1997 forward, HIPUBCOVE is based on a direct question about what kind of insurance the person had. Respondents were shown a flashcard listing insurance types and told to pick which one(s) they (and their family members) had.

For 1997 forward, interviewers began by asking whether each family member had any kind of health insurance coverage. For 1997 to 1999, only persons with an affirmative response to this initial question have responses to follow-up questions about the kind of health insurance and details of coverage

For 1997 to 1999, those who did not answer the initial question affirmatively are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").


Various definitions of Medicaid were provided to respondents, but the changes in the definition were not substantial.

In essence, for 1976 to 1996, Medicaid was defined as a health insurance program that provides medical assistance to persons in need. The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997 forward defined Medicaid as "a medical assistance program that provides health care coverage to low income and disabled persons. The Medicaid program is a joint federal-state program which is administered by the States."


Survey Questions

The order and wording of NHIS questions on health insurance coverage changed over time to reflect the availability of different types of coverage and issues of interest. From 1976 to 1996, respondents were asked a series of questions on whether family members had each of several types of coverage. Starting in 1997, respondents selected the relevant types of coverage from a list on a flashcard. The contents of the flashcard list reflected the types of public programs available at the time. Users are encouraged to read the User Note on "Changes in the Insurance Data Collection Process" for further information.

The survey questions used to collect the information included in HIPUBCOV changed over time.


1997 forward
Interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" For individuals who had an affirmative response, the interviewer asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a flashcard listing various types of insurance coverage, including Medicaid. The options on the card were as follows:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)

Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance, and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

      <txt><![CDATA[HIMCAIDE indicates whether the person currently had health insurance coverage through Medicaid.

Medicaid pays for medical assistance to low-income families with dependent children and to aged, blind, or permanently and totally disabled individuals with incomes insufficient to meet the costs of medical services.

The program became law in 1965. Medicaid is administered by state agencies and is jointly funded by the federal, state, and, sometimes, local governments. Eligibility requirements for this means-tested program vary across states. Most recipients of public welfare income programs such as TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) and SSI (Supplemental Security Income) are eligible for Medicaid coverage. In some states, other persons qualify, such as needy unemployed persons who have children and who are not receiving cash assistance, and medically needy persons whose income and assets are too low to cover their medical costs. Many Medicaid recipients are inmates of medical institutions, such as low-income elderly persons in nursing homes. Such institutionalized persons are not included in the NHIS sample, which covers the civilian non-institutionalized population of the United States.


The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward defined Medicaid as "a medical assistance program that provides health care coverage to low income and disabled persons. The Medicaid program is a joint federal-state program which is administered by the States."

As the Manuals noted, the name for the Medicaid program varies across states. Interviewers were supplied with cards listing "State Names for Medicaid, CHIP, State-/Local-Sponsored, and Other Health Insurance Programs" in their state.

These linked broad categories of insurance that were studied in the survey to recognizable public health insurance program names. For example, in 1999, the California Medicaid program was called the "Medi-Cal" or "Medi-Cal Managed Care" or "The Two-Plan Model."


HIMCAIDE is a recoded variable created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and was included in the original NHIS public use data. HIMCAIDE, like other recoded health insurance variables in these data, is based on responses to a series of questions and by editing carried out by the NCHS.

Data Collection Process

In the survey for 1997 forward, interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?"

Respondents were instructed to "Include health insurance obtained through employment or purchased directly as well as government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that provide medical care or help pay medical bills." In 1997-2003 the survey form instructed interviewers to only read the preceding statement "if necessary."


Individuals who had an affirmative response to the preceding question were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a card listing various types of insurance coverage.

Categories included:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)


Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Respondents were consistently instructed to exclude private plans that "only provide extra cash while hospitalized," but the treatment of single service plans varied across years.

 In 1997-1998 respondents were also instructed to "EXCLUDE private plans that ... pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)." Beginning in 1999, "Single Service Plan" was added as a possible response, and, consequently, the instructions were changed to read, "INCLUDE those [private plans] that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)."


Follow-up questions collected information about the names of coverage plans and confirmed the lack of any type of coverage for the uninsured.

In follow-up questions, interviewers recorded the names of up to four private health insurance plans. If the person was reported as covered by CHIP (beginning in 2000), by a state-sponsored health plan, or by another public program (other than Medicaid) that paid for health care, the interviewer recorded the name of that plan. The placement and wording of these questions about the names of specific government health care plans varied across years.

For persons initially reported as not having health care coverage of any kind, interviewers asked whether the person had Medicare coverage, Medicaid coverage, coverage via a Medicaid program or non-Medicaid state-sponsored health insurance program with the appropriate name for the state, CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA coverage, or any private insurance. For those who acknowledged any such coverage, the interviewer repeated the series of questions mentioned above to determine the specific type of coverage.


Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had.

This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card.


Accordingly, the NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables. For these recoded insurance variables, such as HIMCAIDE, the data are back-edited, taking into account such factors as the proper classification of the verbatim names of insurance plans and responses to questions about why insurance coverage had stopped. The NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type.

Related Variables

In addition to HIMCAIDE, IHIS contains the following recoded insurance variables: HICHIPE (Covered by Children's Health Insurance Program: Recode); HIPRIVATEE (Covered by private health insurance: Recode); HIMILITE (Covered by military health insurance: Recode); HIHSE (Covered by Indian Health Service: Recode); HIMCAREE (Covered by Medicare: Recode); HISTATEE (Covered by other state-sponsored health plan: Recode); and HIOTHGOVE (Covered by other government program: Recode).

Medicare provides health coverage to almost all Americans aged 65 or older. Disabled persons who received cash benefits for 24 months under the Social Security program and persons suffering from end-stage renal disease also have Medicare coverage.

Medicare's Basic Hospital Insurance Plan pays for hospital costs and post-hospitalization services. The Medical Insurance Plan is a voluntary plan covering physicians' services and a variety of medical and health services received either inside or outside hospitals. This second part of Medicare is financed by monthly premium payments and subsidies from federal funds.


The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward defined Medicare as "the federal health insurance coverage for persons age 65+ years of age and certain disabled persons under age 65."

      <txt><![CDATA[HINOTCOV is a recoded variable created by the IHIS staff that indicates, for all persons, whether the individual had any general health insurance coverage.  Uninsured persons include those without any private insurance, or without public health insurance coverage through Medicaid, Medicare, military health care (1976 forward), Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (1999 forward), or a state-sponsored or other government program (1997 forward).  Persons covered only by a private plan that paid for one type of service, such as 
accidents or dental care, are also considered uninsured.  Persons covered only by the Indian Health Service (1993 forward) are coded as having no health insurance.  

For most years, HINOTCOV refers to a current lack of insurance coverage; for 1990 to 1996, the variable refers coverage status during the previous month. 

Methods of Determining Lack of Insurance

The process used to ascertain the lack of insurance coverage reported in HINOTCOV changed over time.  A brief description is provided below, while further information on the data collection process appears in the User Note on "Changes in Insurance Data Collection."


For 1976 to 1999, lack of health insurance was ascertained indirectly.  In other words, having no coverage was inferred from responses to a series of questions on various forms of coverage.  Interviewers asked about coverage through Medicare, Medicaid or other public assistance programs, military health care, and private insurance.  Persons not covered by any of these types of insurance were coded as having no health insurance.

For 1980 to 1996, persons who received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) were assumed to have health insurance coverage, since they were eligible for health care coverage (i.e., Medicaid) through these programs.

For 2000 forward, HINOTCOV reflects a response of "no coverage of any kind" to a direct question about what type of insurance the person had.


Survey questions

The specific questions used to determine coverage status changed over time. 


These questions are as follows:

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPUBCOV is a recoded variable created by the IHIS staff, which indicates, for all persons, whether the individual was covered by a public health insurance program. For all years except 1990-1996, HIPUBCOV refers to coverage at the time of the survey; for 1990-1996, the variable refers to coverage in the past month.

Variable Meaning

HIPUBCOV indicates whether the person had health insurance coverage through Medicaid, any other state or other local government program that pays for health care, or, for 1999 forward, the Children's Health Insurance Program. For 1980 to 1996, HIPUBCOV also includes those who received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), because persons in those programs were automatically enrolled in Medicaid. HIPUBCOV does not indicate coverage through any military health care program (see HIMILANY), Medicare (see HIMCARE) or the Indian Health Service (see HIHSE).

Data Collection

For 1976 to 1996, HIPUBCOV reflects responses to questions about whether the person had insurance coverage through Medicaid or some other public assistance program. For 1976 and 1980, HIPUBCOV is also based on responses to a question about why the person did not have private health insurance or Medicare coverage (see HINORMCAID). For 1980 to 1989, those who reported having a Medicaid card (including those whose cards may have been expired) were given an affirmative response in HIPUBCOV. For 1997 forward, HIPUBCOV is based on a direct question about what kind of insurance the person had. Respondents were shown a flashcard listing insurance types and told to pick which one(s) they (and their family members) had.

For 1997 forward, interviewers began by asking whether each family member had any kind of health insurance coverage. For 1997 to 1999, only persons with an affirmative response to this initial question have responses to follow-up questions about the kind of health insurance and details of coverage

For 1997 to 1999, those who did not answer the initial question affirmatively are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").


Various definitions of Medicaid were provided to respondents, but the changes in the definition were not substantial.

In essence, for 1976 to 1996, Medicaid was defined as a health insurance program that provides medical assistance to persons in need. The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997 forward defined Medicaid as "a medical assistance program that provides health care coverage to low income and disabled persons. The Medicaid program is a joint federal-state program which is administered by the States."


Survey Questions

The order and wording of NHIS questions on health insurance coverage changed over time to reflect the availability of different types of coverage and issues of interest. From 1976 to 1996, respondents were asked a series of questions on whether family members had each of several types of coverage. Starting in 1997, respondents selected the relevant types of coverage from a list on a flashcard. The contents of the flashcard list reflected the types of public programs available at the time. Users are encouraged to read the User Note on "Changes in the Insurance Data Collection Process" for further information.

The survey questions used to collect the information included in HIPUBCOV changed over time.


1976
For 1976, HIPUBCOV indicates Medicaid coverage or welfare received, with the information ascertained indirectly from responses about the person's reasons for not having private insurance or Medicare. Such indirect measurement of public coverage tends to be less accurate than direct questions about coverage, with a bias towards fewer affirmative responses for public coverage.
Which of these statements (Hand card) best describes why -- is not covered by any (private) health insurance plan? Any other reasons? Response categories:  Care received through Medicaid or Welfare

1980, 1982-1984,1986, 1989
For these years, coverage is indicated by receipt of welfare (AFDC or SSI) and by persons reporting having a Medicaid card. Interviewers read a definition of Medicaid ("There is a program called Medicaid that pays for health care for persons in need"), then asked if any family member had a Medicaid card. If the response was affirmative, the interviewer asked to see the Medicaid card to verify coverage.
Does anyone in the family now receive assistance through the "Aid to Families with Dependent Children" program, sometimes called "AFDC" or "ADC"?
Does anyone in the family now receive the "Supplemental Security Income" or "SSI"?
Does anyone in the family now have a Medicaid {or (name)} card? 

In addition, the following questions were asked in these survey years:
1980
Which of those statements describes why -- is not covered by any health insurance plan? Any other reason? Response categories:  Care received through Medicaid or Welfare. 

1982-1984,1986, 1989
Is anyone in the family now covered by any other public assistance program that pays for health care? 

1990-1992
In (month), was anyone in the family covered by Medicaid or (local name)? 
Did -- receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children, sometimes called AFDC or ADC, or some other type of assistance payments in (month)? 
1992 only
In (month), was anyone in the family covered by any OTHER public assistance program (other than Medicaid) that pays for health care? 
In (month), did anyone in the family receive public assistance or welfare payments from the state or local welfare office? 

1993 to 1996
For 1993 to 1996, interviewers read a description of Medicaid to respondents and then asked the following questions:
In (month), was anyone in the family covered by Medicaid? 
In (month), was anyone in the family covered by any OTHER public assistance program (other than Medicaid) that pays for health care? Do NOT include use of public or free clinics if that is the only source of care. 
In (month), did anyone in the family receive public assistance or welfare payments from the state or local welfare office? 
In (month), did anyone in the family receive Supplemental Security Income or SSI? 
Did -- receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children, sometimes called AFDC or ADC, or some other type of assistance payments in (month)? 

1997 forward
Interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" For individuals who had an affirmative response, the interviewer asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a flashcard listing various types of insurance coverage, including Medicaid. The options on the card were as follows:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)

Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance, and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, HIPRIVATE is a recoded variable created by the IHIS staff, which indicates whether the person was covered by a comprehensive private health insurance plan.  For all years, those with single service plans only (i.e., those that paid for one type of care, such as nursing home care, accidents, or dental care) are not considered to have private health insurance.  However, private plans that pay extra cash while hospitalized were considered to be health insurance until 1989.

For all years except 1990-1996, insurance coverage refers to coverage at the time of the survey; for 1990-1996, the reference period is the previous month.

Changing Definition of Private Health Insurance

Along with changes in question order and wording, the definition of private insurance changed over time, to reflect the changes in the availability of different types of private coverage and issues of interest. Users are strongly encouraged to review these changes in the User Notes " Changes in Insurance Data Collection" and "Changes in the Definition of Private Insurance". A summary of such changes is provided below.


For 1976-1989, plans that only provide extra cash while the person was hospitalized were considered to be health insurance. However, the Field Representative's Manuals for these years instructed interviewers to exclude other forms of single service plans, such as "[those covering] dread diseases (cancer, polio), plans that pay only for accidents, plans that pay only for dental bills, [and] "income maintenance" (which pay a fixed amount both in and out of the hospital). Interviewers were also instructed to exclude public programs, including Medicaid, Medicare, public welfare, "Crippled Children's Program," care given to military personnel, and veterans' benefits.

For 1976 to 1992, the survey questions on private insurance asked about coverage for hospital, surgeon or doctor's bills. For 1986 and 1989, the question also included coverage for dentists' bills. The1986 Manual defined dental coverage as "any insurance which pays all or part of a dentist's bill for any dental services other than oral surgery." The 1989 and 1992 Manuals noted that dental coverage had to be part of a comprehensive plan, and not a single service plan, to count. For 1989 and 1992, single service plans were not considered to be private health insurance.

For 1993 to 1996,  the Manuals instructed interviewers to consider single service plans as a form of private health insurance.

For 1997 forward, private health care plans are any insurance other than public programs. Such plans may be provided in part or in full by an individual's employer or union, and they may also be purchased directly. For 1997 forward, respondents were asked what kind of health insurance they had and shown a flashcard that listed types of insurance coverage. Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance, and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Beginning in 2004, the Field Representative's Manuals instructed interviewers to treat COBRA and TCC coverage as private insurance. The Manuals discussion of COBRA and TCC was as follows:

If a respondent indicates that he/she is covered by COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) or by TCC (Temporary Consolidation of Coverage), this should be coded as a Private Health Insurance Plan from employer or workplace. COBRA provides a bridge between health plans for qualified workers, their spouses and their dependent children when their health insurance might otherwise be cut off. Under this act, if a person voluntarily resigns from a job or is terminated for any reason other than 'gross misconduct,' they are guaranteed the right to continue in their former employer's group health insurance plan as an individual or family health care coverage for up to 18 months at one's own expense. In some cases, a spouse and dependent children are also eligible for COBRA coverage for as long as three years.

The TCC program is similar to COBRA. This program is available to federal employees. If a person loses Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) coverage because of separation from federal service, they may enroll under the TCC provision of FEHB law to continue coverage for up to 18 months at their own expense in a FEHB plan. Family members who lose coverage because they are no longer eligible may enroll under TCC to continue FEHB coverage for up to 36 months at their own expense.


Survey Questions

The survey questions collecting information about private insurance coverage changed over time.


1976, 1980
Is anyone in the family covered by hospital insurance, that is, a health insurance plan which pays any part of a hospital bill? 
Is anyone in the family now covered by a health insurance plan which pays any part of hospital, doctor or surgeon's bill? 

1980, 1982-1984,1986,1989
 (Not counting Medicare) is anyone in the family now covered by a health insurance plan which pays any part of hospital, doctor or surgeon's bill? 
1986, 1989: or dentist bills, dental bills
1989: Do NOT include plans that pay for ONLY ONE type of service such as nursing home care or accidents.

1990-1991
 Health insurance can also be obtained privately or through a current or former employer or union. Was anyone in the family covered by private health insurance or by membership in a health maintenance organization in (month)? 

1992
 (Not counting the government health programs we just mentioned,) In (month) was anyone in the family covered by a private health insurance plan? Do NOT include plans that pay for ONLY ONE type of service, such as nursing home care or accidents. 

1993-1996
 (Not counting the government health programs we just mentioned,) In (month) was anyone in the family covered by a private health insurance plan? 

1997 forward
Interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" Individuals who had an affirmative response were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents were handed a flashcard that listed various insurance types and told to mark all that applied; response categories for private insurance included:
Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)

For 1997 to 1999, only persons with an affirmative answer to the initial question about having insurance have responses to follow-up questions about the type of health insurance and the details of coverage; for 1997 to 1999, those who did not answer the initial question affirmatively are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").

      <txt><![CDATA[For all respondents, HIMCAID indicates whether the respondent had Medicaid coverage. For 1990 to 1996, it reflects coverage during the previous month. For 1997 forward, it reflects coverage at the time of the survey. 

Users who want to compare Medicaid coverage over time should review the variable description HIPUBCOV, which may more accurately capture all respondents who were covered by Medicaid.

Note that the universe changed between 1999 and 2000, although this should not affect affirmative responses for this variable. For 1997 to 1999, it reflects responses of all persons who already indicated they had some form of health insurance. For 2000 forward it reflects responses of all persons. 

Various definitions for Medicaid were provided to respondents over time, but the changes in definition were not substantial. Medicaid was generally defined as a health insurance program which provides medical care for persons in need. The Field Representative's Manual for 1997 forward defined Medicaid as "a medical assistance program that provides health care coverage to low income and disabled persons. The Medicaid program is a joint federal-state program which is administered by the States."


Medicaid pays for medical assistance to low-income families with dependent children and to aged, blind, or permanently and totally disabled individuals with incomes insufficient to meet the costs of medical services. The program became law in 1965. Medicaid is administered by state agencies and is jointly funded by the federal, state, and, sometimes, local governments. Eligibility requirements for this means-tested program vary across states. Most recipients of public welfare income programs such as TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) and SSI (Supplemental Security Income) are eligible for Medicaid coverage. In some states, other persons qualify, such as needy unemployed persons who have children and who are not receiving cash assistance, and medically needy persons whose income and assets are too low to cover their medical costs. Many Medicaid recipients are residents of medical institutions, such as low-income elderly persons in nursing homes. Such institutionalized persons are not included in the NHIS sample, which covers the civilian, non-institutionalized population of the United States.

As the manuals noted, the name for the Medicaid program varies across states. Interviewers were supplied with cards listing "State Names for Medicaid, CHIP, State-/Local-Sponsored, and Other Health Insurance Programs" in their state. These linked broad categories of insurance that were studied in the survey to recognizable public health insurance program names. For example, in 1999, the California Medicaid program was called the "Medi-Cal" or "Medi-Cal Managed Care" or "The Two-Plan Model."


The definition, order and wording of private health insurance changed over time to reflect changes in the availability of different types of coverage and issues of interest.  Users are strongly encouraged to review the user note Insurance Data Collection [URL omitted from DDI.].

      <txt><![CDATA[For all persons (only those 65 and older in 1976), HIMCARE indicates whether the person had Medicare coverage. It reflects the verbatim response to a question on whether the person (or family member) had Medicare (for 1976 to 1996) or what kind of insurance the respondent (or family member) had. It is not comparable with the recoded variable HIMCAREE, which reflects responses edited for accuracy by the NCHS. See the comparability tab for more details.

For 1997 to 1999, it reflects responses of all persons who already indicated they had some form of health insurance. For 2000 forward it reflects responses of all persons. 

Various definitions for Medicare were provided to respondents over time, but the changes in definition were not substantial. Medicare was defined as a health insurance program for certain disabled persons and for persons age 65 years old and older.


Medicare provides health coverage to almost all Americans aged 65 or older. Disabled persons who received cash benefits for 24 months under the Social Security program and persons suffering from end-stage renal disease also qualify for Medicare coverage. Medicare's Basic Hospital Insurance Plan pays for hospital costs and post-hospitalization services. The Medical Insurance Plan is a voluntary plan covering physicians' services and a variety of medical and health services received either inside or outside hospitals. This second part of Medicare is financed by monthly premium payments and subsidies from federal funds

In 1976, Medicare coverage for persons under 65 was inferred from answers to questions for reasons why the person had no insurance (HINORMCARE, care received through Social Security Medicare).

Data Collection Process

1997 forward interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?" and individuals who had an affirmative responses were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?"

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a state or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)

For 1997 forward, in addition to excluding Medicare and Medicaid, HIOTHGOV refers to public coverage other than a State-sponsored health care program, and for 1999 forward, also other than the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

Over the years, the term "other" always referred to public insurance apart from the public programs already asked about in the survey. The question order and the specific programs included in the interview prior to the question on "other public program" changed over time.

Except for 1992-1996, HIOTHGOV refers to coverage at the time of the interview; for 1992-1996, HIOTHGOV refers to coverage in the previous month. 

Users are strongly encouraged to review the user note Insurance Data Collection [URL omitted from DDI.] .

Survey questions

For 1982 to 1996, respondents were asked a series of questions about whether family members had each of several types of public assistance coverage. For 1997 forward, respondents could select "other government program" from a list of different types of coverage.

The specific questions used to determine coverage through some other government program changed over time.


1999 forward
What kind of health insurance or health care coverage {do/does} {you/subject's name} have? INCLUDE those that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care), exclude private plans that only provide extra cash while hospitalized. 
1997-1998
What kind of health insurance or health care coverage {do/does} {you/subject's name} have? EXCLUDE private plans that only provide extra cash while hospitalized or pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care). 
1993-1996
In (month), was anyone in the family covered by any OTHER public assistance program (other than Medicaid) that pays for health care? (Do NOT include use of public or free clinics if that is the ONLY source of care.)
1992
 (In (month), was anyone in the family covered by) any OTHER public assistance program, other than Medicaid, that pays for health care? 
1982-1984,1986,1989
Is anyone in the family now covered by any other public assistance program that pays for health care? 


For 1997 forward respondents were first asked if they (and each family member) were covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan.  For 1997 to 1999, only those with an affirmative answer to this initial question have responses to follow-up questions about the type of health insurance and the details of coverage.

 For 1997 to 1999, those who did not answer the initial question affirmatively are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").


For years prior to 1997, the relevant questions for HIOTHGOV referred to "public assistance" programs.

The Field Representative's Manuals for 1982 through 1989 indicate that other public assistance programs include welfare which may provide health care benefits. For 1984 to 1989, interviewers were instructed not to include church-sponsored programs or "charitable foundations" (such as Shriner's Children's Hospitals or the American Cancer-Society), if this information was volunteered. The Manuals for 1992 to 1996 do not provide a specific definition of "other public assistance."


Prior to 1997, questions on coverage through military health care programs occurred after the question for HIOTHGOV.

As such, it is possible that respondents covered by such programs indicated a "yes" response for HIOTHGOV. Analysis by IHIS staff indicates that a very small fraction of respondents who indicated coverage through HIOTHGOV were also covered by a military health care program. These persons may have had both types of coverage.


For 1997 forward, Field Representative's Manuals describe "other government program" as a "catch-all category for any public program providing health care other than those" already categorized.

In other words, HIOTHGOV for 1997 forward refers to some government program other than Medicare, Medi-gap, Medicaid, SCHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program), Military health care, Indian Health Service, or a State sponsored health plan.

      <txt><![CDATA[SINGLE is a recoded variable created by the IHIS staff, which indicates whether the person was covered by an insurance plan that only paid expenses for one type of health care service. In 1989 and for 1999 forward, having such a single service plan did not count as having health insurance. For 1993 to 1996, by contrast, the NHIS recognized single service plans as a form of insurance coverage. In 1993-1996, persons who reported having any form of private insurance were asked for clarification of whether their plan paid for "a variety of health care services" (i.e., was comprehensive coverage) or "for only one type of service or care" (i.e., was a single service plan).

Users are strongly encouraged to review the user notes Insurance Data Collection [URL omitted from DDI.] and Private Insurance Definitions [URL omitted from DDI.].

Related variables
For 1999 forward, the following variables reflect the type of single service plans available:
 SSAIDS: Single service plan for AIDS care
 SSCANCER:  Single service plan for cancer treatment 
 SSCATAST: Single service plan for catastrophic care 
 SDENTALE: Single service plan for dental care 
 SSDISABL: Single service plan for disability insurance 
 SSDRUGS: Single service plan for prescriptions 
 SSHOSPIC: Single service plan for hospice care
 SSHOSPIT: Single service plan for hospital care
 SSLONGT: Single service plan for long-term care 
 SSVISION: Single service plan for vision care
 SSOTHER: Single service plan for some other type of care 


Definition and Classification of Single Service Plans

The Field Representative's Manuals for 1989 and 1999 forward stated that single service plans were not a form of private comprehensive insurance.

The 1989 Manual defined single service plans ("specialty health care" plans) as "usually limited to one type of service and frequently obtained to supplement a comprehensive plan that may not provide that type of coverage." 1989 was the first year in which information on single service plans was collected, for the Manual noted they were a "relatively new concept." The 1989 Manual instructed interviewers not to include, among single service plans, those comprehensive plans that had additional benefits paid for in the premium payment. For example, "some comprehensive plans pay for prescriptions and this coverage is included in the premium payment. This service would be considered part of their comprehensive plan and not a single service." Interviewers could probe to determine whether a particular service was included in the respondent's comprehensive coverage.

For 1993 to 1996, respondents were asked whether they had any private insurance, including single service plans. If the answer was affirmative, they were then asked whether the plan paid for a variety of services (a comprehensive plan) or one type of service.


Survey Questions

The wording of questions about single service coverage changed over time.

      <labl>Type of Medicare coverage</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For people with Medicare coverage, MCARETYP reports the type of Medicare coverage.

MCARETYP is a recoded variable created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and is included in the original NHIS public use data. MCARETYP, like other recoded health insurance variables in the NHIS data, is based on responses to a series of questions and back editing carried out by the NCHS.

Definitions

People were asked their type of Medicare coverage only if they had Medicare coverage (HIMCAREE). The NCHS provides the following definition of "Medicare":

Medicare: Medicare "is a nationwide health insurance program providing health insurance protection to people 65 years of age and over, people entitled to social security disability payments for 2 years or more, and people with end-stage renal disease, regardless of income. The program was enacted July 30, 1965, as Title XVIII, Health Insurance for the Aged of the Social Security Act, and became effective on July 1, 1966. From its inception, it consists of two separate but coordinated programs, hospital insurance (Part A) and supplementary medical insurance (Part B).


For persons who responded affirmatively to having Medicare, interviewers were instructed to ask for their Medicare card. If the respondent was able to provide the card, interviewers were instructed to categorize the respondent's Medicare coverage as Part A, Part B, or both Part A and Part B. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provides succinct characterizations of both Part A Medicare coverage and Part B Medicare coverage:


Part A Medicare Coverage: "Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) helps cover inpatient care in hospitals, including critical access hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities (not custodial or long-term care). It also helps cover hospice care and some home health care. Certain conditions must be met to get these benefits."
Part B Medicare Coverage: "Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) helps cover doctors' services and outpatient care. It also covers some other medical services that Part A doesn't cover, such as some of the services of physical and occupational therapists, and some home health care. Part B helps pay for these covered services and supplies when they are medically necessary."


Data Collection Process

In the survey for 1997 forward, interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?"  

Respondents were instructed to "Include health insurance obtained through employment or purchased directly as well as government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that provide medical care or help pay medical bills."  In 1997-2003 the survey form instructed interviewers to only read the preceding statement "if necessary."


Individuals who had an affirmative response to the preceding question were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?"  Respondents selected the appropriate response from a card listing various types of insurance coverage.

 The choices included:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward) 
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)   


Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Respondents were consistently instructed to exclude private plans that "only provide extra cash while hospitalized," and single service plans were also excluded.

In 1997-1998 respondents were also instructed to "EXCLUDE private plans that ... pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)."  Beginning in 1999, "Single Service Plan" was added as a possible response, and, consequently, the instructions were changed to read, "INCLUDE those [private plans] that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)."

In follow-up questions, interviewers recorded the names of up to four private health insurance plans.  If the person was reported as covered by CHIP (beginning in 2000), by a state-sponsored health plan, or by another public program (other than Medicaid) that paid for health care, the interviewer recorded the name of that plan. The placement and wording of these questions about the names of specific government health care plans varied across years.


As already noted, people were asked their type of Medicare coverage only if they had already indicated that they had Medicare coverage.

Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had. 

This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on a card provided by the interviewer. 


Accordingly, the NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables. For these recoded insurance variables, the data are back edited, taking into account such factors as the proper classification of the verbatim names of insurance plans and responses to questions about why insurance coverage had stopped.

Because of the errors in the respondents' original (unedited) answers to questions about insurance coverage, the NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers.

Only persons having an affirmative response to the recoded Medicare coverage variable, HIMCAREE, were included in the universe of MCARETYP.]]></txt>

Thus, throughout the period, HINOTYR is asked of people (specifically excluding armed forces members in 1997-1999) who report currently having health insurance coverage via any of the following: private health insurance, including Medi-Gap; Medicare; Medicaid; Children's Health Insurance Program; Military health insurance (including Military Health Care/VA and TRICARE/CHAMPUS/CHAMP-VA); Indian Health Service; State-sponsored public health care coverage plans; and other government programs.

For 2000 forward, HINOTYR is not asked of people reporting only single service plan coverage.

Use of HINOTYR

According to the NCHS, HINOTYR should not be used to estimate the prevalence of uninsurance, due to data errors. 

During the course of data editing, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on a card provided by the interviewer. Accordingly, the NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables. For these recoded insurance variables, the data are back-edited, taking into account such factors as the proper classification of the verbatim names of insurance plans and responses to questions about why insurance coverage had stopped.

Because of errors in respondents' original (unedited) answers to questions about insurance coverage, the NCHS warns that "the variables HILAST and HINOTYR, which reflect periods of non coverage, cannot be used to estimate the rate of uninsurance." 


Instead of using HINOTYR, researchers should using the health insurance recodes, estimating the rate of uninsurance as a residual, according to NCHS. Please see the variable description for HIPRIVATEE [Covered by private health insurance: Recode]. Or use the IHIS drop down menu and search functions for other related variables.

Data Collection Process

In the survey for 1997 forward, interviewers first asked, "Are you covered by health insurance or some other kind of health care plan?"

Respondents were instructed to "Include health insurance obtained through employment or purchased directly as well as government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that provide medical care or help pay medical bills." In 1997-2003 the survey form instructed interviewers to only read the preceding statement "if necessary."


Individuals who had an affirmative response to the preceding question were asked, "What kind of health insurance or health care coverage do you have?" Respondents selected the appropriate response from a card listing various types of insurance coverage.

The choices included:

Private health insurance (2004 forward)
Private health insurance plan from employer or workplace (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan purchased directly (1997-2003)
Private health insurance plan through a State or local government program or community program (1998-2003)
Medicare (1997 forward)
Medi-Gap (1997 forward)
Medicaid (1997 forward)
CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) (1999 forward)
Military Health Care/VA (1997-2003)
Military Health Care (CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA) (1997 forward)
Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)


Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Respondents were consistently instructed to exclude private plans that "only provide extra cash while hospitalized," but the treatment of single service plans varied by year.

In 1997-1998 respondents were also instructed to "EXCLUDE private plans that ... pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)." Beginning in 1999, "Single Service Plan" was added as a possible response, and, consequently, the instructions were changed to read, "INCLUDE those [private plans] that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)."


Follow-up questions collected information about the names of coverage plans and confirmed the lack of any type of coverage for the uninsured.

In follow-up questions, interviewers recorded the names of up to four private health insurance plans. If the person was reported as covered by CHIP (beginning in 2000), by a state-sponsored health plan, or by another public program (other than Medicaid) that paid for health care, the interviewer recorded the name of that plan. The placement and wording of these questions about the names of specific government health care plans varied across years.

For persons initially reported as not having health care coverage of any kind, interviewers asked, in sequence, whether the person had Medicare coverage, Medicaid coverage, coverage via a Medicaid program or non-Medicaid state-sponsored health insurance program with the appropriate name for the state, CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA coverage, or any private insurance. For those who acknowledged any such coverage, the interviewer repeated the series of questions mentioned above to determine the specific type of coverage. Those who did acknowledge any such coverage were asked the question associated with HINOTYR, namely, "In the past 12 months, was there any time when [person] did not have any health insurance coverage?"

Thus, throughout the period, HINOTYRMO is asked of people (specifically excluding armed forces members in 1997-1998) if two criteria are satisfied:

The person reported currently having health insurance coverage via any of the following: private health insurance, including Medi-Gap; Medicare; Medicaid; Children's Health Insurance Program; Military health insurance (including Military Health Care/VA and TRICARE/CHAMPUS/CHAMP-VA); Indian Health Service; State-sponsored public health care coverage plans; and other government programs.
The person responded affirmatively to HINOTYR, indicating that there was some point in the past 12 months at which he or she had no health insurance overage.

For 2000 forward, HINOTYRMO is not asked of people reporting only single service plan coverage.

Use of HINOTYRMO

According to the NCHS, HINOTYRMO cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of uninsurance, due to data errors.

During the course of data editing, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Often, respondents misclassified the type of insurance they had. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on a card provided by the interviewer.

For these recoded insurance variables, the data are back-edited, taking into account such factors as the proper classification of the verbatim names of insurance plans and responses to questions about why insurance coverage had stopped.

Because of the errors in respondents' original (unedited) answers to questions about insurance coverage, HINOTYRMO (and the complementary variable HINOTYR) cannot be used to estimate the rate of uninsurance.


To estimate the extent of uninsurance, the NCHS recommends using the health insurance recodes, estimating the rate of uninsurance as a residual. See the variable description for  HIPRIVATEE (Covered by private health insurance: Recode) for more details.

Users can also use HINOTCOVE, a recoded variable that indicates whether the person currently lacks health insurance coverage.

Data Collection Process

Indian Health Service (1997 forward)
State-sponsored health plan (1997 forward)
Other government program (1997 forward)
Single Service Plan (e.g., dental, vision, prescriptions) (1999 forward)
No coverage of any type (2000 forward)


Respondents could pick more than one type of insurance and interviewers were instructed to mark all that applied.

Respondents were consistently instructed to exclude private plans that "only provide extra cash while hospitalized," but the treatment of single service plans varied by year.

In 1997-1998 respondents were also instructed to "EXCLUDE private plans that ... pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)." Beginning in 1999, "Single Service Plan" was added as a possible response, and, consequently, the instructions were changed to read, "INCLUDE those [private plans] that pay for only one type of service (nursing home care, accidents, or dental care)."


Follow-up questions collected information about the names of coverage plans and confirmed the lack of any type of coverage for the uninsured.

In follow-up questions, interviewers recorded the names of up to four private health insurance plans. If the person was reported as covered by CHIP (beginning in 2000), by a state-sponsored health plan, or by another public program (other than Medicaid) that paid for health care, the interviewer recorded the name of that plan. The placement and wording of these questions about the names of specific government health care plans varied across years.

For persons initially reported as not having health care coverage of any kind, interviewers asked, in sequence, whether the person had Medicare coverage, Medicaid coverage, coverage via a Medicaid program or non-Medicaid state-sponsored health insurance program with the appropriate name for the state, CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA coverage, or any private insurance. For those who acknowledged any such coverage, the interviewer repeated the series of questions mentioned above to determine the specific type of coverage. Those who acknowledged current coverage by health insurance (specifically excluding armed forces members in 1997-1998), were asked the question associated with HINOTYR ("In the past 12 months, was there any time when [person] did not have any health insurance coverage?"). If they responded affirmatively to HINOTYR, they were then asked the question associated with HINOTYRMO, namely, "In the past 12 months, about how many months was [person] without coverage?"

      <labl>Reasons for no insurance: Too expensive</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[HINOCOSTR is a recoded variable created by the IHIS staff, which indicates whether the person did not currently (except for 1993 to 1996 when coverage status referred to the previous month) have health insurance due to the expense or cost of insurance. 

Data Collection Process

Those who were asked their reason for not having insurance did not have coverage through Medicare, Medicaid or some other public health insurance program, military health care, or comprehensive private insurance. Except for 1993-1996, those who only had single service plans were classified as uninsured and included in the universe for this variable.  For 1980-1996, the universe excludes those receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), as recipients were eligible for health care through these programs. 

For all years, interviewers asked the reason(s) why the person had no insurance and handed the respondent a flashcard with various responses (including "other").  Initially, respondents were prompted to pick all responses that applied; for 2000 forward, they could specify up to five reasons only.  The response categories listed on the card changed over time.  For 1976-1996, HINOCOSTR includes those selecting the response "too expensive, can't afford health insurance"; for 1997, it includes those who selected "insurance plan raised cost of premiums"; and for 1997 forward, it includes those who selected "cost is too high." 

Survey questions

The wording of questions about cost barriers to insurance coverage changed over time.


1976, 1980, 1982-1984, 1989, 1993-1996
Many people do not carry health insurance for various reasons. Hand Card   Which of these statements describes why -- is not covered by any health insurance (or Medicare)? Any other reason? (Anything else?)Circle all responses given.

2000 forward *Enter up to 5 reasons. 


HINOCOSTR differs somewhat from other variables in the original NHIS public use files that relate to cost barriers to insurance coverage.

 
The related variables from the original NHIS public use files include:

 HINOREXPEN  (Reasons for no insurance: Too expensive)
HISTOP10A (Why coverage stopped: Insurance plan raised premium cost)
HISTOP11 (Why coverage stopped: Cost is too high)

HINOCOSTR excludes persons with health care coverage through public programs, such as Medicaid or Military health care, whereas the variables listed above include such individuals for some years. For example, for 1993 to 1996, individuals could respond that a reason for "no insurance" was coverage through a public program.  Unlike the original public use variables, HINCOSTR also excludes all those covered by AFDC or SSI, which improves comparability between earlier years and 1997 forward.

      <txt><![CDATA[HINOREFUSER is a recoded variable created by the IHIS staff, which indicates whether the person did not currently have insurance coverage because the insurance company refused coverage (except for 1993 to 1996 when coverage status referred to the previous month).

Data Collection Process

Those who were asked their reason for not having insurance did not have coverage through Medicare, Medicaid or some other public health insurance program, military health care, or comprehensive private insurance. Except for 1993-1996, those who only had single service plans were classified as uninsured and included in the universe for this variable. For 1993-1996, the universe excludes those receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), as recipients were eligible for health care through these programs.

For all years, interviewers asked the reason(s) why the person had no insurance and handed the respondent a flashcard with various responses (including "other"). Initially, respondents were prompted to pick all responses that applied; for 2000 forward, they could specify up to five reasons only. The response categories listed on the card changed over time. For 1976-1996, HINOREFUSER includes those selecting the response "can't obtain because of poor health, illness, or age"; for 1997 forward, it includes those selecting "insurance company refused coverage."

Users may also want to review information about the component variables used to create HINOREFUSER.

Those variables are:

HINORPOORH (Reasons for no insurance: Can't obtain due to poor health/age) (1976 to 1996).
HISTOP12 (Why coverage stopped: Insurance company refused coverage) (1997 forward)


HINOREFUSER differs from these component variables in excluding persons covered by public insurance programs, and, for the period prior to 1997, excluding recipients of AFDC and SSI.

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPWORKR is a recoded variable created by the IHIS staff, which indicates whether insurance was obtained through an employer, union, or workplace. For all years except 1997 to 1999, the universe consists of persons with a private health insurance health plan. For 1997-1999, the universe is persons who had some form of health insurance. For 1995 forward, self-employed persons who obtained insurance through a professional association count as having insurance through the workplace.

Except for 1990-1996, HIPWORKR refers to coverage at the time of the interview; for 1990-1996, HIPWORKR refers to coverage in the previous month. 

For 1991 and 1990, HIWORKR is constructed from responses to HIWORK (private health insurance obtained through employer or union), which was released by the NCHS with no persons in the "unknown--don't know" category.

Number of Plans Considered

There were changes over time in the number of insurance plans considered when collecting information about how insurance was obtained.

Information was collected on "any plan" for 1976 and 1980; on to up to five plans in 1982; on up to six plans in 1983; on up to five plans for 1984-1989; on "any plan" for 1990 and 1991; and on up to four plans per family for 1992 forward. Beginning in 2004, the NHIS public use files reported data only for plans one and two.

The recoded HIPWORKR variable is based on responses to questions on coverage under plans one through five for 1982-1989, plans one through four for 1992-2003, and plans one and two for 2004 forward.  Changes in the number of insurance plans considered should have little effect on the results for HIPWORKR.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response in HIPRIVGT2 (available for 2004 forward). Analysis by IHIS staff indicates that a very small number of persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had three or more private insurance plans.


 Definition of Private Insurance

The definition of private insurance changed over time. Users are encouraged to review the User Note about "Changes in the Definition of Private Insurance." The description below is an abbreviated version of the detailed information in that User Note.


For all years except 1993-1996, single service plans and plans that pay only for accidents were not considered to be health insurance.

For 1976 to 1989, plans that paid "extra cash" for hospital stays were considered to be health insurance, while for 1992 forward, they were not.

For 1993 to 1996 only, having just a single service plan was treated as having health insurance.

For 1999 forward, a separate category for single service plans was added to the flashcard listing types of insurance coverage, which further distinguished single service plans from comprehensive private health insurance.

For 1976 to 1989, the Field Representative's Manuals defined private insurance as "specifically designed to pay all or part of the hospital, doctor, surgeon, or other medical expenses of the insured individual" (including dentist expenses for 1989 and 1986). The Manuals further noted, "The plan, in order to be considered as insurance, must be a formal one with defined membership and benefits. Include Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Individual Practice Associations (IPAs), such as Kaiser, Group Health, etc."

For 1990 forward, the  Manuals defined private health insurance to be any type of health insurance, including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), other than the public programs of Medicare, Medicaid, Military health care/VA, CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA, Indian Health Service, state-sponsored health plans, CHIP (the Children's Health Insurance Plan, beginning in 1999), and health insurance from other government programs.

For 2001 forward, the Manuals indicated that insurance coverage through COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) or by
TCC (Temporary Continuation of Coverage) should be considered private health insurance (obtained through an employer or workplace).


Survey questions

For all years, interviewers first asked whether respondents (and their family members) were covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan.

For 1997 to 1999, only people with an affirmative answer to this initial question have responses to follow-up questions about the kind of health insurance and the details of coverage; for 1997 to 1999, those who did not answer the initial question affirmatively are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up question on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or "no insurance").


The specific questions that were used to ascertain private insurance coverage through the workplace changed over time.


2004 forward: 
Which one of these categories best describes how this plan was obtained?
Response categories: Through employer; through union; Through workplace

1997-2003 forward: 
Was this plan originally obtained through the workplace, such as through a present or former employer or union? 

1993-1996
 (Not counting the government health programs we just mentioned,) In (month) was anyone in the family covered by a private health insurance plan? 
Was this plan originally obtained through the workplace, that is, through a present or former employer or union? 

1992
 (Not counting the government health programs we just mentioned,) In (month) was anyone in the family covered by a private health insurance plan? Do NOT include plans that pay for ONLY ONE type of service, such as nursing home care or accidents. 
Was this plan obtained through an employer or union? 

1991
 Health insurance can also be obtained privately or through a current or former employer or union. Was anyone in the family covered by private health insurance or by membership in a health maintenance organization in (month)? 
 Was any of [name] health insurance obtained through an employer or union?

1982-1984,1986,1989
 (Not counting Medicare), is anyone in the family now covered by a health insurance plan which pays any part of hospital, doctor or surgeon's bill? 
1986, 1989  or dentist bills, dental bills
1989: Do NOT include plans that pay for ONLY ONE type of service such as nursing home care or accidents.
Was this plan originally obtained through the workplace, that is, through a present or former employer or union? 

1976, 1980 
Is anyone in the family covered by hospital insurance, that is, a health insurance plan which pays any part of a hospital bill? 
Is anyone in the family now covered by a health insurance plan which pays any part of hospital, doctor or surgeon's bill? 
Was this plan obtained through an employer or union?

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPBUYOWNR is a recoded variable created by the IHIS staff, which indicates, for all persons who had at least one private health insurance health plan (except for 1997 to 1999), whether they had a plan that was purchased directly, rather than through an employer or union. For 1997 to 1999, the universe includes those who mentioned they had some form of health insurance.

Number of Private Plans Considered

There were changes over time in the number of insurance plans considered when collecting information about private health insurance purchased directly.

Information was collected on "any plan" for 1976 and 1980; on to up to five plans in 1982; on up to six plans in 1983; on up to five plans for 1984-1989; on "any plan" for 1990 and 1991; and on up to four plans per family for 1992 forward. Beginning in 2004, the NHIS public use files reported data only for plans one and two.

The recoded HIPBUYOWNR variable is based on responses to questions on coverage under plans one through five for 1982-1989, plans one through four for 1992-2003, and plans one and two for 2004 forward.

Changes in the number of insurance plans considered should have relatively little effect on the results for HIPBUYOWNR.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response in HIPRIVGT2 (available for 2004 forward). Analysis by IHIS staff indicates that a very small number of persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had three or more private insurance plans. For 2004 forward, information on third and fourth insurance plans is available only through the restricted access files available through Research Data Centers.


Users are strongly encouraged to review the user notes Insurance Data Collection [URL omitted from DDI.] and Private Insurance Definitions [URL omitted from DDI.]. 

Data Collection Process

For all years, interviewers first asked whether each family member was covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan. (Proxy reporting was allowed, so one person might provide this information for all family members.) Persons without an affirmative response to this opening query were treated differently beginning in 2000. 


For 1997 to 1999, only people with affirmative responses to this initial question were included in follow-up questions about the kind of health insurance and the details of coverage; for 1997 to 1999, those without an affirmative response to the initial question are coded NIU (not in universe) for follow-up questions on insurance characteristics. Beginning in 2000, the response "no insurance" was included as a valid response to the initial question. Thus, for 2000 forward, the universe for follow-up questions on insurance coverage type and details was "all persons" (including those with an affirmative response to HINONE or reporting "no insurance").


For 1976 to 1996, HIPBUYOWNR reflects a negative response indicating the plan was not obtained through an employer or union.

For these survey years, respondents were only asked a yes/no question about whether their private plan was obtained through an employer or union. Respondents who answered "no" were considered to have plans purchased directly. For 1995 forward, self-employed persons with insurance obtained through professional associations are included as having insurance through the workplace, not purchased directly.


For 1997 forward, respondents were handed a flashcard listing various types of health insurance and asked to pick which one(s) they had (or how the insurance was obtained, for 2004 forward). HIPBUYOWNR reflects the response category "purchased directly."

Survey Questions

The wording of questions used to ascertain whether private insurance was purchased directly changed over time.


1976, 1980 
Is anyone in the family covered by hospital insurance, that is, a health insurance plan which pays any part of a hospital bill? 
Is anyone in the family now covered by a health insurance plan which pays any part of a hospital, doctor or surgeon's bill? 
Was this plan obtained through an employer or union? 

1982-1984,1986,1989

Data Editing and Recoding

During the course of data editing, the NCHS staff discovered many errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. Such errors became apparent, for example, through mismatches between the verbatim names of insurance plans and the type of insurance coverage people selected from categories on a flashcard. Users should be aware that the responses for HIPBUYOWNR prior to 1997 have not been edited for accuracy, and respondents may have mistakenly reported their insurance information.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HIPSELFR is a recoded variable created by the IHIS staff, which indicates, for each person who had at least one private health insurance health plan, whether he or she had at least one plan that was paid for by that person or by another family member living in the same household.  

Survey text
Interviewers asked "Who pays for this health insurance plan?" and handed the respondent a flashcard that listed various responses.  The respondent was directed to pick all applicable answers.  

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data on plans one and two are publicly available.  Therefore, for 1997 to 2003, HIPSELFR indicates whether respondents had any of up to four plans paid for by themselves (or by a co-resident family member); for 2004 forward, the variable reflects responses based  on two plans.  Changes in the number of insurance plans considered have little effect on the results for HIPSELFR.

Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable which is for available for 2004 forward.  Analysis by IHIS staff indicates that a very small number of persons (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) had three or more private insurance plans.


Definition of Private Insurance

For 1997 forward, the Field Representative's Manuals defined private health insurance to be any type of health insurance, including Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), other than the public insurance programs of Medicare, Medicaid, military health care/VA, CHAMPUS/TRICARE/CHAMP-VA, Indian Health Service, state-sponsored health plans, and other government programs (including CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Plan, beginning in 1999).  

For 2001 forward, the Manuals indicated that insurance coverage through COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) or by 
TCC (Temporary Continuation of Coverage) should also be considered private health insurance (obtained through an employer or workplace).

The definition of private insurance and the data collection process for insurance variables changed over time. (See the User Notes on "Changes in the Definition of Private Insurance" and "Changes in the Data Collection Process for detailed discussion of these issues.) For 1997 forward, however, the data collection process and definition of private insurance remained largely the same (and consistently excluded single service plans).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons who have a private insurance plan, this variable indicates the person's first plan was paid for by Medicaid.

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data on the first and second plan are publicly available. Uses may also want to see the variables HIP1CAID, HIP3CAID, and HIP4CAID.  Users may also want to see the variable description for HIPCAIDR, a recoded variable created by the IHIS staff, which indicates if the respondent had any private plan paid for by Medicaid.

Private insurance companies are allowed to administer portions of Medicaid benefits through Medicaid managed care arrangements in which health maintenance organizations contract directly with a state Medicaid agency to provide services on a capitated basis (fixed fee per enrollee). These managed care plans then enroll and provide services for Medicaid beneficiaries. For example the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provided a listing of insurance plans contracting with Medicaid in each state in a 2009 report entitled, "2009 National Summary of State Medicaid Managed Care Programs." Users may want to review other documents on the CMS website for further information on such payment arrangements.

HIP1CAID was edited by the NCHS.  Responses were edited based on the plan name to improve accuracy. 


To clarify, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. Relevant to HIP1CAID, only respondents verified to have private insurance are included in the data for HIP1CAID. A full description of the editing that occurred is provided under the variable descriptions for HIPRIVATEE.

      <txt><![CDATA[For persons who were covered by a private insurance plan that was paid for by the person or a family member living in the household, ("2" for HIP1SELF), this variable indicates the amount spent for insurance premiums, including payroll deductions. Respondents provided the amount in dollars spent on premiums (as a continuous measure) and the time period (month, week, etc). The IHIS recode for HIP1COST also indicates whether the amount reported was more than $20,000 dollars (code "20000").

For 1999 to 2001, interviewers asked respondents for the amount paid on premiums in the past 12 months (e.g., "During the PAST 12 MONTHS, how much did {you/your family} spend for health insurance premiums for {plan name}?"). For 2002 forward, respondents were asked how much they (or their family} currently spend for health insurance premiums for each plan and could then specify the time period for the expenditure (e.g., once a week, a month or yearly). For 2002, responses were recoded to indicate annual expenditure.

In general, the definition and measurement of private health insurance for 1999 forward remained consistent. Single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents were not considered private insurance. Users are strongly encouraged to refer to HIPRIVATEE for more information on the change in measurement of private insurance over time.

Data Editing and Recoding
For 1997 forward, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card.

Related variables 

The IHIS has also created the variable HIPEMPAYR, available for 1989 forward for years in which survey data is available, which indicates whether the respondent had any private plan paid for by the employer.

Please use the IHIS drop down menu and search functions for other related variables.

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available. Users may also want to see the related variables HIP2EMP, HIP3EMP, and HIP4EMP. 

 Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable (available for 2004 forward). Very few people (less than 0.2 percent of the total number of individuals with private health insurance per year for 2004 to 2009) have more than two private insurance plans. Additional information for the third and fourth plans for a person is available through a Data Research Center. See the 2004 Survey Description document available on the NHIS website for more information.


For all years, HIP1EMP is available, the definition of private insurance coverage remained relatively consistent and excluded single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents. However, the definition, order, and wording of private health insurance changed over time.  Users are strongly encouraged to review the user note Private Insurance Definitions [URL omitted from DDI.].

Data Editing and Recoding

For 1997 forward, HIP1EMP reflects responses that have been edited by the NCHS based on plan name. Only respondents verified to have private insurance are included in the data for HIP1EMP.  A full description of the editing process and changes in definition is provided under the variable descriptions for private insurance in HIPRIVATEE; a brief description is provided under the "more" link below.


To clarify, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. The NCHS created a series of recoded insurance variables, which are edited to correct for respondents mistakes of insurance information. The NCHS strongly advises analysts to use these recoded insurance variables as a more reliable source of information about the types of insurance coverage than is provided by respondents' original and unedited answers about their insurance type.

Data Editing and Recoding
For 1997 forward, the NCHS edited responses as to what type of insurance coverage persons had based on plan names. The frequencies provided in HIP1TYPE reflect responses that have been verified though editing based on plan names. A full description of the editing process and the definition of private insurance is provided under the variable description for HIPRIVATEE.

To clarify, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. Relevant to HIP1TYPE, someone may have mistakenly reported having private insurance when in fact they in did not. These individuals are not included in the frequencies reported in HIP1TYPE.

For 1999 to 2001, interviewers asked respondents for the amount paid on premiums in the past 12 months (e.g., "During the PAST 12 MONTHS, how much did {you/your family} spend for health insurance premiums for {plan name}?"). For 2002 forward, respondents were asked how much they (or their family} currently spend for health insurance premiums for each plan and could then specify the time period for the expenditure (e.g., once a week, a month or yearly). For 2002, responses were recoded to indicate annual expenditure.

In general, the definition and measurement of private health insurance for 1999 forward remained consistent. Single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents were not considered private insurance. Users are strongly encouraged to refer to HIPRIVATEE for more information on the change in measurement of private insurance over time.

Data Editing and Recoding
For 1997 forward, during the course of data editing, the NCHS discovered errors in the responses to questions about insurance coverage. This might be shown, for example, by a mismatch between the verbatim name of an insurance plan and the type of insurance coverage the person selected from the categories on the card. The responses for HIP2COST reflect editing by NCHS to ensure that respondents do have private insurance. A full description of the editing process and changes in definition is provided under the variable descriptions for private insurance in HIPRIVATEE.]]></txt>

Related variables 

The IHIS has also created the variable HIPEMPAYR, available for 1989 forward for years in which survey data is available, which indicates whether the respondent had any private plan paid for by the employer.

Please use the IHIS drop down menu and search functions for other related variables.

Information was collected on up to four plans per family; for 2004 forward, only data for plans one and two are publicly available. Users may also want to see the related variables HIP1EMP through HIP4EMP.  Persons with three or more plans have a "yes" response to the HIPRIVGT2 variable (available for 2004 forward).  Additional information for the third and fourth plans for a person is available through a Data Research Center. See the 2004 Survey Description document available on the NHIS website for more information.

For all years, HIP2EMP is available, the definition of private insurance coverage remained relatively consistent and excluded single service plans or plans which paid only for accidents. However, the definition, order, and wording of private health insurance changed over time.  Users are strongly encouraged to review the user note Private Insurance Definitions [URL omitted from DDI.].

Data Editing and Recoding

For 1997 forward, HIP2EMP reflects responses that have been edited by the NCHS based on plan name. Only respondents verified to have private insurance are included in the data for HIP2EMP.

For all years respondents were first asked if they are covered by any kind of health insurance or some other kind of health care plan.

Respondents were handed a card listing possible reasons for no insurance and were asked to specify up to five reason(s) or could specify 'other'.  For all years, individuals with coverage through single service plans were asked for reasons for no insurance, because those with single service plans were considered to be uninsured.

Apart from 1997, response categories listed on the card remained the same. HISTOP14 was not a recognized response in 1997, but respondents could indicate this through the "other reason" category. While the response, "lost Medicaid/medical plan because of new job or increase in income" remained the same for 1997 forward, other categories changed slightly between 1997 and 1998 forward.
